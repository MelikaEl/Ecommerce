export {default} from "./Root"
/*
The line `export {default} from "./Root"` is a shorthand ES6+ syntax for re-exporting a default export. Let me explain its functionality and common use cases:

1. **What it does**:
- It imports the default export from `./Root`
- Immediately re-exports it as the default export of the current file
- It's equivalent to:
```javascript
import Root from "./Root";
export default Root;
```

2. **Why use it**:
- **Clean Imports**: Allows other files to import from a cleaner path
  ```javascript
  // Instead of:
  import Root from "./pages/Root/Root";
  
  // You can write:
  import Root from "./pages/Root";
  ```
- **Index Pattern**: Common pattern in React for organizing components
- **Barrel Exports**: Helps create a single entry point for a folder

3. **Common folder structure**:
```
src/
  pages/
    Root/
      ├── index.js      // Re-export file
      ├── Root.js       // Main component
      ├── Root.styles.js
      └── Root.utils.js
```

4. **Benefits**:
- Better organization of code
- Cleaner imports in other files
- Ability to change internal file structure without affecting imports elsewhere
- Follows the principle of encapsulation

This pattern is particularly common in React applications as it helps maintain clean and organized code structure while providing flexibility for future refactoring.
